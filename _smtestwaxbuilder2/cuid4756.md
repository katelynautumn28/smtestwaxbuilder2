description: This is a legal record of ownership of Shelter Island, with mention that
  the island was originally owned by the Indigenous Manhansucke people, who called
  the island “Ahaquatzunamocke." This document is also emblematic of the Sylvester
  Manor’s relationship to the Barbados plantations, and the Sylvesters’ dependency
  on the slave trade.
