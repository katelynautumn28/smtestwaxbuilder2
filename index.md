This is a test site for the Sylvester Manor Project at NYU. It is built using WaxBuilder, a minimal, static site-builder for digital collections built on the shell of [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/). WaxBuilder includes added features borrowed from [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io) and [Joseph Anderson](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives) of the Fashion Institute of Technology NYC's Digital Initiatives, including different data download formats, a timeline, an interactive web map, subject tags, and more.
