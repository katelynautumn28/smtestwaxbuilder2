WaxBuilder is a tool built on the shell of [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/), a minimal, static site-builder for digital collections. WaxBuilder includes added features borrowed from [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io) and [Joseph Anderson](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives) of the Fashion Institute of Technology NYC's Digital Initiatives, including different data download formats, a timeline, an interactive web map, subject tags, and more.

Each include, layout, and folder includes a doc entitled "doc.md" that provides information about how to use that folder or file to customize your site.

Before using WaxBuilder, I suggest you familiarise yourself with Wax, including the Wax documentation. You may need the [supplemental documentation for Wax](https://kam535.github.io/wax-documentation/), available from Cornell University's Digital CoLab to help you, since Wax's documentation is scant. [Wax Docs +](https://kam535.github.io/wax-documentation/) will also include specific WaxBuilder documentation soon (insha'Allah).
