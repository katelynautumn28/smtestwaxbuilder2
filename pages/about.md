WaxBuilder was created by the Collections as Data Librarian at Cornell Univerity's Digital CoLab using the open-source exhibition platform [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/). The project is supported by the Collections as Data Librarian, the Director of Digital Scholarship Services, and the Emerging Data Practices Librarian at Cornell University Library's [Digital Scholarship Services](https://www.library.cornell.edu/about/staff/central-departments/digital-scholarship/).

Originally conceived as a combination of the features of Wax and CollectionBuilder, WaxBuilder was developed by a digital humanities librarian. Questions about WaxBuilder can be directed to digitalcolab@cornell.edu. 

The tag carousel features at the bottom of the Browse page are loosely based on a the Subjects and Locations clouds from Collection Builder. The map and data downloads are modified versions of the CollectionBuilder map and data features. The timeline is a slightly modified version of [Joseph Anderson's](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives) [museum timeline](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives/museum-timeline). The teaching tools section is self-made using simple CSS flexboxes (hence the wonkiness). The audio and video items use a custom layout.
